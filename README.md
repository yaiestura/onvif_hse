# ONVIF Practice #1
In the words of Jack Jansen(the maintainer of MacPython):

> Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a good idea it takes about 1 minute and five lines to program something that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want.

- ## demo.py
This script allows to retreive ONVIF IP-camera PTZ Configurations, Supported PTZ Spaces
- ## absolute.py
- ## abs_move.py
- ## ptz_control.py
- ## focus.py
